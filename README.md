#exterminator

Deadly ex-perimental termin-al debugger (it's an ncurses front-end for GDB).

Because why can't I just have GDB with a better (Turbo-C style) UI and less typing?

##goals

* runs on GNU/Linux
* interactive visual output
* loads immediately, no mess, no fuss
* runs super-fast - instant stepping, quick key commands

##platforms

* GNU/Linux is the target platform
* It accidentally works on OS X because BSD
* MS Windows is not a build target - it might work, don't care - Windows is a toy for children.
